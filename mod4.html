    <h1>Exploring Javascript Benchmarks</h1>

    <p>
      I recently explored the concept of a programming benchmark, a performance test that could be run accross
      multiple languages, platforms, or sets of parametric constraints in order to inform decision making. Particularly
      important for many businesses and design teams is to choose the correct technology/language at the onset 
      of a design task. The decision of choosing the correct technology often considers how the performance of
      the code scales with memory/bandwidth growth. Linear scaling of such systems is usually desired. In my activity,
      I studied how the time required for memory storage scaled with the amount of memory. Such a study would
      be relevant for e-businesses evaluating their growth in overhead as they expand their customer base/server loads.
      <a href="code/benchmark.html">Here</a> is some of my code. Note: in my code you must manually call the test
      function "benchmark_1" from the console, passing in the number of elements you wish to be stored in the
      array. The results of my benchmark tests, shown above, illustrate a linear relationship between time 
      required for memory storage and the amount of memory stored. In a business setting, management could use
      this data to plan for the growth of their hardware overhead to grow proportionaly with their customer base.
