    <h1>Raycasting with 2D WebGL</h1>
    <p>
      In 1992, 21 year old John Carmack overcame the hardware limitations of early PC's 
      through an innovative approach to faking 3D graphics which he called "ray casting". This module
      is to pay hommage to, and provide an instructional example of this computer graphics technique which 
      gave birth to Wolfenstein 3D, the first ever person shooter video game.
