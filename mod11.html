		MagicaVoxel is a voxel-based 3D art design software that is very easy to use. I created the above
			character in ten minutes using MagicaVoxel. I was then able to export my character as
			an obj model, zip the .obj, .mtl, and .png files, and upload to Mixamo.com to add
			an animation. I exported my animated character from Mixamo.com and added it via drag
			and drop to a simple Model Viewer template from PlayCanvas.
