<h1>Lists in the Scheme Programming Language</h1>

 I was given a problem that involved creating a list in scheme and getting a particular element from that list using the built-in
 functions called "car" and "cdr". I created a list called "listA" that contained 7 elements which were the numbers 1 through 
 7. I then used "car" and a series of "cdr"s to obtain the desired element. Finally, I used a shorthand for "car" and "cdr" to 
 obtain the same element in less keystrokes. <a href="code/scheme-list-fun.ss" target="_blank">Here</a> is the code I wrote.
